<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood and more importantly,
    how they break. Through university and hands-on IT work, I've developed
    practical experience in networking, system administration, troubleshooting,
    and security fundamentals.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current interests include cloud computing, penetration testing, network security,
    and secure infrastructure design.
